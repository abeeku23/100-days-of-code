### Day 0: April 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 19% through Codeacademy's Python track

### Day 1: April 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a PygLatin translator
**Thoughts:** The CodeAcademy IDE is annoying to use

### Day 2: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started to dive deeper into MongoDB for a side project
**Thoughts:** Trying to apply my relational database ideology to NoSQL has made it a striggle but slow readin through documentation is very beneficial


### Day 3: May 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forgot to do this yesterday smh; Started with the mockup for a side project for a web app. This would be the first time I'm using a mock up app
**Thoughts:** I could code this in HTML/CSS but I don't want to get bogged down with a lot of code only for my customers to change their opinion
